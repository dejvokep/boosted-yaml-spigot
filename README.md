# ðŸ”¼ BoostedYAML for Spigot

An extension for BoostedYAML with a serializer implementation supporting the Spigot (Bukkit) API serialization system.

This artifact is designed to be imported into and packaged with your project together
with [BoostedYAML](https://github.com/dejvokep/boosted-yaml). This change was imposed starting with release 1.5 in order
to isolate the development of the two projects.

on the project's [repository page](https://github.com/dejvokep/boosted-yaml).
